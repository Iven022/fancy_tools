Fancy Tools

## Getting Started

This project is mainly for git users but can be helpful for other users for sure.
It offers a series of aliases such as :
1) gss = git status
2) gap = git add
3) gpl = git pull
4) gpu = git push

And also a function with simplifies the git commit code making it more understandable and quicker. For exemple the code :
gco this is my commit message will send the code git commit -m "[current branch you are working] this is my commit message"
With the function gco you don't need to put your message between inverted commas. Just gco yourMessage. 

The folder you downloaded is a git repository and you can work on it and add your own modifications, don't worry it's not that folder that is linked to your .bashrc file and for your modifications to take place you just have to push your modications to the branch master and run the utility file named updateFancyFiles to update your computer with your modifications.

### Prerequisites

You just need to clone the git repository onto your computer or download it's zip file and extract it.

### Installing

You just need to execute the file install.sh into your terminal and the job is done with the code : ./install.sh

note:*Sometimes you need to give the file executable rights for it to be able to install on your pc, the code to fix that is :chmod +x install.sh*
